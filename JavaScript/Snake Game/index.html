<!-- Also there is another thing i wanted to tell u. Ive been wanting to tell u this for a long time now. But i thot tdy might be appropriate since u werent able to play val. Earlier i was able to play it without any issues. But as soon as i'd see u online, id either try to ff or if i was playing in a group, id leave it immediately so that i cud play with u. I always had so much more fun when i used to play together with u obviously cus u were arnd but also becus i cud just be myself rather than trying to be someone different like i usually am in my groups. But as soon as u'd leave the game, idk i too wud suddenly wanna stop playing val. idky but it always happened only whenever i played with u and not with anybody else. i know its wierd. But after u'd leave someone wud always play with me which always helped me stop thinking bout u. But tdy nobody was able to join. Thats y as soon as i started talking to u in the morning, i managed to ff the game i was playing. And again in the afternoon, when u msgd me mid game i again managed to ff so that i cud talk to u. And that was it. I stopped playing val for the rest of the day and just spent it talking to u or just playing something stupid on my phone so that again i cud just use it as a distraction. Sry i just wanted u to know this. Its been coming for a while now but i just thot that tdy might be a good time to let u know this. I guess im just finding it a bit more difficult to move on compared to the other girls that i liked. -->
